# Creating a Yearbook in the Student's side pane

## Prerequisites
1. This tutorial requires you to have the Professor M package installed. Please find the instructions [here](https://github.com/sugarcrm/uncon/tree/2017/ProfessorM)
2. Download `images.zip` and uncompress it on your machine.
3. Open Postman, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner, select `Manage Environments` and click on the `Professor M` environment that you created previously.
4. Add a key called "Note_Path" and fill in the value with the absolute path of your `images` folder. Example: `/Users/<username>/Desktop/images`
5. Click on `Update` and then download the environment file.
6. Download `Notes_PostmanCollection.json` from this repo.
6. Install newman with `npm install -g newman` in your terminal. If you don't have `npm` installed, please install it: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
7. Run: `newman run path/to/Notes_PostmanCollection.json --environment <environment_file>`. This creates Notes records in your instance and links the images to them.
